HEllo World
My name is dan and i have decided to persue a career in front end web development.
A little about myself-
I am 23 years old and live in the mountains of west virginia with my wife hope. I enjoy anything that is artistic and educational, especially history.
I also have adhd,which does have its challenges with being a self taught programmer. 
My goals-My goal is to develop a career in web development.
Eventually moving onto artificial intelligence programs similar to "hey google" or "siri" and augmented reality. 
I want to be able to help create programs and enviorments that not only help the whole world move foward but can also help those, like myself, who suffer from add or adhd. 
Its hard for me to communicate and mae friends, so im joining this community with the hopes of developing new friendships and relationships to push me foward towards my goals. 
How to contact me? 
You can find on Facebook, Discord, Linkedin @The.Pagan.Programmer. 
I hope to meet and find new people to establish a good foundation among the computer nerd community.
